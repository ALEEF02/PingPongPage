		<h1>What are the rules to play games?</h1>
		<div style="margin: 10px;">
			<p>Games are typically played as first to 21 points. A rally is played to determine the server. The serve switches every 5 total points. The winner must win <em>by 2 points</em>.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<h1>How do ratings work?</h1>
		<div style="margin: 10px;">
			<p>We use the Glicko2 system to rank players. It has been used in countless ranking applications and stands as one of the best ranking systems currently available.<br>
				Each player has 3 values:<br>&emsp;
					<b>Rating</b> or your 'elo'. It's how skilled the system currently thinks you are. Every player starts at 1400.<br>&emsp;
					<b>Rating Deviation:</b> The standard deviation or confidence of your rating. Lower numbers means that your rating is more accurate.<br>&emsp;
					<b>Volatility:</b> How consistent your play is. If you have lots of on and off days, you'll have a higher volatility. If your gameplay is consistent, it will lower.<br>
				Using these 3 values we can gather the skill of your gameplay.<br><br>

				From each game we can calculate a "score" against each opponent. Score varies from 0-1, where 0 is a loss, 0.5 is a draw, and 1 is a win. In games like chess, score would be purely one of these 3 possibilities. At PingPongPage, we've decided to use a spectrum instead.<br>&emsp;
					We start by calculating the game "diff". Diff is <code>(winner's score - loser's score) / total points played</code>.<br>&emsp;
					We then plug diff into <code>0.5 - ([ (1 / log(21)) * log((20 * diff) + 1) ] / 2)</code>, which is the "loss rate".<br>&emsp;&emsp;
						If the player won, simply subtract loss rate from 1 to reciprocate it.<br>&emsp;
					This score value can be visualized here: <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/h2efschvsv">https://www.desmos.com/calculator/h2efschvsv</a><br><br>

				Every "Rating Period", currently </p><p id="numGames"></p><p> games, we'll batch evaluate the games that have been played. This is why your values will not change after each game. Having a Rating Period prevents "racing" conditions where, if say 2 games are submitted but the second game is accepted first, the 3 values of the players in the first game would have changed, even though when the game was played they were different.
